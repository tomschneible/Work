"""Fill a per-test SAT/DSAT score-report template's "Student Responses"
tab with one student's name, test date, and answers.

Structurally different from the ACT templates (see score_report_writer.py
and scoresheet_grid.py) in three ways, all confirmed against a real blank
template and its filled counterpart:

  - Every block has its own title directly above it, rather than one
    shared title governing several -- e.g. "R & W Module 2 - Higher
    Difficulty" titles just that one block, not a run of blocks to its
    right the way ACT's "English" does. Handled here by exploiting a
    layout fact that made this simpler than porting scoresheet_grid's
    title-attribution logic: a title's own column always equals its
    block's question-number column, so a title unambiguously identifies
    exactly one block by column alone.
  - Module 1 and Module 2 both number their questions starting at 1, so a
    block can't be identified by (subject, question) the way ACT's
    (section, question) works -- answers are keyed by
    (subject, module_slot, question) instead, module_slot being
    "module1", "easier", or "harder".
  - Each subject has two *pairs* of Module-2 blocks -- two "Higher
    Difficulty" blocks, two "Lower Difficulty" ones -- not one of each.
    Confirmed against the blank template: within a pair, the correct-
    answer key is byte-identical, so which twin is used is arbitrary;
    this always uses the leftmost and never touches its duplicate.

    A boolean flag cell above the block's own question-number column
    tells the sheet's own score formulas whether that column-group
    counts -- but there's only ONE row of these flags on the whole
    sheet (confirmed against the blank template: every subject's score
    formulas reference the exact same handful of cells, e.g. Math's own
    "correct count" formula reads $O$8/$V$8/$AC$8/$AJ$8, not a
    Math-specific row), reused by column position across every subject
    stacked underneath it. Harmless by construction, not something this
    needs to special-case: an inactive block is always left with blank
    "Your Answer" cells, and a blank cell's mark formula produces neither
    "✔" nor "✘", so it never affects a count regardless of what its
    shared flag happens to be set to. Module 1 has no flag cell at all
    (everyone takes it, nothing to disambiguate). Located here via one
    sheet-wide scan for boolean-valued cells, keyed by column -- not by
    searching near any one block's own header row, which is what a
    later-appearing subject's blocks actually need.

Which difficulty (easier/harder) was actually administered isn't
something this module figures out -- that identification already exists
in answer_keys.annotate_rows, matching a score report's own "Correct
Answer" column against a reference key. Callers pass the result in via
`active_variants`.
